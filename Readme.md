# This project focuses on the development and evaluation of a neural network model for handwritten digit recognition, a fundamental task in machine learning. The primary objective is to build an efficient classification model using a fully connected feed forward neural network. The model includes three dense layers with ReLU and softmax activations, trained using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss function. The model was trained on digit image datasets and tested on custom test data. While initial test accuracy was low (10%), structured training improved the modelâ€™s prediction capabilities. Overall, the project demonstrates the importance of architectural tuning in enhancing neural network performance for image classification tasks.
